# callback_modules
This is a collection of callback modules for ansible.

### Yaml2 ### 
Currently working on making it a more robust callback module.

Changes:
Incorporates the stdout of the minimalist callback module that is default for ansible ad-hoc with the yaml module so that the stdout is still shown when using ad-hoc commands.
